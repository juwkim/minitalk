## 💡 About the project

> _The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals._

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/juwkim/42cursus/blob/main/Subject%20PDFs/02_minitalk.pdf).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **C compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

- Pull files ↙️
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/juwkim/minitalk
```

- To build minitalk ↙️
```shell
$ make
```

- To clean all object files (.o) and executable files ↙️
```shell
$ make fclean
```

- To check this repository complies with [norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette) ↙️
```shell
$ make norm
```

## 📋 Testing

To test the program you just need to launch the \<server\> and the \<client\> in different shell tabs with the following:

```shell
$ ./server
```

This will show your PID to make the \<client\> work and will stay waiting to receive a message from the \<client\>

```shell
$ ./client <PID> <message>
```

By launching it, this will show <message> on the \<server\> window.
